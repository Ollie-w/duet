            <h3>Select your brand new instrument from our curated range</h3>
                <div class="flex-image"><img src="images-static/shop.jpg" alt=""></div>
                <p>Our online catalogue features multiple options for every member of the orchestra along with all the other most popular learner instruments like guitars, recorders and drum kits. All the stringed instruments are available in a selection of sizes down to 1/16 to ensure that even the youngest players can learn with ease. There are also many pianos and large percussion instruments available for those with the space - schools and orchestras will finally be able to manage the cost of these valuable investments by spreading the cost over several months or years. As well as instruments, our range includes vital consumables and accessories such as music stands and audio equipment.</p>

                <div class="flex-image"> <img src="images-static/drums.jpg" alt=""></div>
               <p>The cost of every instrument and accessory can be split over a choice of 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 or 60 months. Please note: there is a minimum monthly payment of £2.50 – if your choice doesn’t reach this threshold, you'll need to add more items to your basket! If you make all the payments, the instrument is yours to keep forever with nothing extra to pay!</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, if you've paid at least half you can send it back to us. It's worth bearing in mind that if you plan to use Duet to hire an instrument for a short time it will be cheaper for you to select the shorter plans with the higher monthly cost. The exact contract terms can be found here.</p>

                <div class="flex-image"> <img src="images-static/trombone.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Instead of a normal shop checkout we have an extremely clever automated online application and credit reference system. To complete the process, you'll need your bank details, mobile phone number, email address, and credit/debit card details to hand. You'll get an instant result, and if accepted will proceed to e-sign a contract and pay the first instalment.
                </p>
                    <p>This all happens online, so there’s no confusing paperwork and no waiting time! Please telephone us on <a href="tel:01233896820">01233 896820</a> or write to us if you want to have details of the credit reference agencies or any other agencies from whom we obtain, and to whom we pass, information about you.</p>

                    <p>After e-signing the contract and paying the first instalment, you'll be sent a confirmation email and courier tracking details. You will receive your instrument in 3-5 days unless it’s out of stock at the time of ordering, in which case delivery time may extend to a week. If you’ve still not received your order after this time,<a href="#"> contact us</a> and we'll do our best to resolve any problems immediately.

                    <p>All the instruments that leave our warehouse are set up and ready to play unless otherwise stated in the product description.

                    <p>If you keep up payments for the full term, the instrument is yours to keep forever, just like a phone contract. You can cancel the agreement after having paid at least 50% of the rental payments on condition that you return the instrument to us (at your own expense) to Duet Group, Bank House, Bank Street, Ashford, Kent, TN23 1BX. Provided the goods are undamaged and in sound condition, we will then cancel the plan and you will not need to pay anything more. Please contact our <a href="#">Customer Service Team</a> for further advice.
